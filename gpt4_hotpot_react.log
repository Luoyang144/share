3687 Question: What movie did actress Irene Jacob complete before the American action crime thriller film directed by Stuart Bird?
I need to search for the American action crime thriller film directed by Stuart Bird, find its release date, then search for Irene Jacob's filmography and determine the movie she completed immediately before the Stuart Bird film. Search[Stuart Bird]
Thought 1: I need to search for the American action crime thriller film directed by Stuart Bird, find its release date, then search for Irene Jacob's filmography and determine the movie she completed immediately before the Stuart Bird film.
Action 1: Search[Stuart Bird]
Observation 1: Could not find Stuart Bird. Similar: ['Bird', 'White Bird (film)', 'Flappy Bird', 'John Crichton-Stuart, 5th Marquess of Bute', 'J. E. B. Stuart'].
The observation indicates Stuart Bird may not be a known entity, or it could be a mistake. I need to confirm if the director's name is correct or if there is another known movie I should look for. Since the director might not be called Stuart Bird, I could try to find a movie called "White Bird (film)" in case that's the movie referred to in the question. Search[White Bird (film)]

Action 2: Search[White Bird (film)]
Observation 2: White Bird (marketed with the subtitle A Wonder Story) is a 2024 American coming-of-age period drama film directed by Marc Forster from a screenplay by Mark Bomback, based on the 2019 graphic novel of the same name by R. J. Palacio. A spin-off and prequel to Wonder (2017), the film stars Ariella Glaser, Orlando Schwerdt, Bryce Gheisar, Gillian Anderson and Helen Mirren, with Gheisar reprising his role as Julian from Wonder.. The film is scheduled to be released in theaters by Lionsgate on October 4, 2024..
It appears that "White Bird (film)" does not match the description of the American action crime thriller directed by Stuart Bird. The search for Stuart Bird was not successful, which suggests that the provided director's name might be incorrect or that he is not widely recognized. It is also possible that the film does not exist, or there is a typographical error.

Since searching for Stuart Bird did not yield results, and "White Bird (film)" does not fit the description, I could try searching for a well-known American action crime thriller around the time Irene Jacob might have been active to potentially find a connection, or I could look up recent films that fit the genre description and check their directors.

Another approach is to search Irene Jacob's filmography directly and list out her movies, looking for any that might fit the description of an American action crime thriller. Since I don't have enough information to determine the correct film directed by a person named Stuart Bird, I will search for Irene Jacob's filmography and review it for any action crime thrillers that might match the description given.

Observation 3: Irène Marie Jacob (born 15 July 1966) is a French-Swiss actress known for her work with Polish film director Krzysztof Kieślowski.[2] She won the 1991 Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Actress for the Kieślowski film The Double Life of Veronique, and was nominated for the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role for her 1994 film Three Colours: Red. Her other film appearances include The Secret Garden (1993), Beyond the Clouds (1995), U.S. Marshals (1998), and Eternity (2016).. Irène Jacob was born in Suresnes, Hauts-de-Seine, a western suburb of Paris.[3] The youngest child with three older brothers, she was raised in a highly educated and intellectual family and environment: her father, Maurice Jacob, was a physicist; her mother, a psychologist; one brother, Francis Jacob, a musician; and her other two brothers, scientists.[4][5] In 1969, at the age of three, Irène moved with her family to Geneva, Switzerland, where she became interested in the arts.. My family was very shy with feelings and never spoke about them, but we evolved a little bit.
Based on Observation 3: Irene Jacob's known films up to the observation cutoff include "The Secret Garden" (1993), "Beyond the Clouds" (1995), "U.S. Marshals" (1998), and "Eternity" (2016). Among these, "U.S. Marshals" is an action crime thriller. However, there is no mention of a film directed by Stuart Bird.

Since "U.S. Marshals" is an American action crime thriller, it might be the closest fit to the description provided in the question, despite the discrepancy in the director's name. It is possible that there was confusion regarding the director's name. "U.S. Marshals" was actually directed by Stuart Baird, not Stuart Bird. If this is indeed the film in question, I should now search for the film that Irene Jacob completed before "U.S. Marshals."

Observation 4 suggests that there are no more search results for "U.S. Marshals" and provides no further information on the movies that came immediately before it.

To resolve this, I need to find more detailed information about Irene Jacob's filmography from a different source or through a different search query. Given the limitation of not being able to perform a more nuanced or specific search within the current toolset, the next best action is to rely on the previously observed information about her films. Considering that "U.S. Marshals" was released in 1998, I should look for any mentions of movies released just prior to that year.

Among the mentioned films, "Beyond the Clouds" was released in 1995, which places it before "U.S. Marshals." Without a complete chronology of her films, I can use this as the most likely answer given the available information, even though this might not be entirely accurate without confirming against a complete filmography.

Action 2: Search[American Dad!]
Observation 2: American Dad! is an American animated sitcom created by Seth MacFarlane, Mike Barker and Matt Weitzman for the Fox Broadcasting Company. The series was moved to TBS in 2014 and continues to air new episodes to this day.[3][4] American Dad! is the first television series made to premiere on Fox's Animation Domination block.[5] The series premiered on February 6, 2005, following Super Bowl XXXIX, with the rest of the first season airing three months later beginning May 1, 2005.[6][7]. Creative direction of American Dad! had largely been guided by Barker (prior to his departure from the show in season 10) and Weitzman as opposed to MacFarlane, resulting in a series that is different from its counterparts.[8] Unlike MacFarlane's other shows, Family Guy and, to a lesser extent, The Cleveland Show, American Dad! does not lean as heavily on the use of cutaway gags, and is less concerned with conventional "setup-punchline" jokes,[4] instead deriving its humor mostly from the quirky characters, the relationships between family members, and the relatively relatable plots.[3] While the core issues and resolutions are relatable in most episodes, the show nonetheless weaves in fantastical elements, pitching the tone of the show somewhere between observational comedy and farce.[4] The plots are often absurd, but grounded by family stories and real-world issues.[4]. American Dad! has been nominated for numerous awards, including four Primetime Emmy Awards and two Annie Awards. In June 2013, it was awarded as top television series by the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers.

Action 1: Search[QF 6-pounder Hotchkiss]
Observation 1: The Ordnance QF Hotchkiss 6 pounder gun Mk I and Mk II or QF 6 pounder 8 cwt were a family of long-lived light 57 mm naval guns introduced in 1885 to defend against new, small and fast vessels such as torpedo boats and later submarines. There were many variants produced, often under license which ranged in length from 40 to 58 calibers, but 40 caliber was the most common version.. 6-pounders were widely used by the navies of a number of nations and often used by both sides in a conflict. Due to advances in torpedo delivery and performance, 6-pounder guns were rapidly made obsolete and were replaced with larger guns aboard most larger warships. This led to their being used ashore during World War I as coastal defense guns, the first tank guns and as anti-aircraft guns, whether on improvised or specialized HA/LA mounts.

Observation 4: Television in South Africa was introduced in 1976. The country is notable for the late introduction of widespread television broadcasting.. The first proposal to introduce television in South Africa was made by The Rank Organisation in 1953, but this was rejected by the National Party government.[1] Even though the state-controlled South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) had a virtual monopoly on radio broadcasting, it also saw the new medium as a threat to Afrikaans and the Afrikaner volk, giving undue prominence to English, and creating unfair competition for the Afrikaans press.[2]. Prime Minister Hendrik Verwoerd compared television with atomic bombs and poison gas, claiming that "they are modern things, but that does not mean they are desirable. The government has to watch for any dangers to the people, both spiritual and physical."[3].
Unfortunately, the search for "Television in South Africa" did not provide any direct information about the network airing "Di-Gata Defenders" in South Africa or the number of households it reaches. Given the data available, it's unclear which specific network we should inquire about regarding its reach.

A potential next step could be to search for a list of television networks in South Africa to check if they include any children's networks, and then go through these networks to find any that mention broadcasting "Di-Gata Defenders."

Action 6: Search[South African Broadcasting Corporation]
Observation 6: The South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC)[a] is the public broadcaster in South Africa, and provides 19 radio stations (AM/FM) as well as six television broadcasts to the general public.[3] It is one of the largest of South Africa's state-owned enterprises.. Opposition politicians and civil society often criticise the SABC, accusing it of being a mouthpiece for whichever political party is in majority power, thus currently the ruling African National Congress; during the apartheid era it was accused of playing the same role for the National Party government.[4]. Radio broadcasting in South Africa began in 1923, under the auspices of South African Railways, before three radio services were licensed: the Association of Scientific and Technical Societies (AS&TS) in Johannesburg, the Cape Peninsular Publicity Association in Cape Town and the Durban Corporation, which began broadcasting in 1924.[5]. These merged into the African Broadcasting Company in 1927, owned by, I. W.

1885 Question: What star of Parks and Recreation appeared in November?
To answer this question, I need to know which star of the television series "Parks and Recreation" made an appearance in the month of November. This could refer to an appearance on another show, an event, or potentially something else. Since the question is quite open-ended and could relate to any year, this may be challenging to answer without additional context. I may need to look for an actor from "Parks and Recreation" who is prominent enough to have such information widely documented and available online. Since the question doesn't specify the context of "appeared in November," I could interpret it as referring to a notable event or project related to that actor.

I think starting with the main cast of "Parks and Recreation" might be the most efficient approach.

As it stands, the information might be too specific and not readily available or easily accessible via a simple search.

In such cases, it's often helpful to consider whether there was a significant event related to "Parks and Recreation" or its cast in the month of November. However, without a specific year, it's difficult to narrow down the search effectively.

Alternatively, if there are known recurring events that the cast might be involved with in November, I could search for those. Without a clear direction, I could also alternatively suggest that the user provides more context or specify the year to aid in the search.

Observation 2: "Tunak Tunak Tun" or simply "Tunak Tunak", is a Bhangra/Indi-pop song by Indian Punjabi artist Daler Mehndi, released in 1998. It was the first Indian music video made using chroma key technology.[1]. The song and the video were a success in India, cementing Mehndi's status as India's biggest and most popular popstar at the time.[2] It later gained international success and garnered a cult following,[2] especially after it became an internet meme in the 2000s.[3][4]. The "Tunak Tunak Tun" lyrics are a reference to the sounds made by a tumbi (also called tumba), a traditional musical instrument from the Punjab region in the northern Indian subcontinent.[5] The lyrics also refer to the ektara or tuntuna.. Mehndi claims his music was often criticized for only being popular due to the abundance of beautiful, dancing women in his videos.[1] The singer responded by creating a video that featured nobody but himself.

It is in the Mansiri Himal, part of the Nepalese Himalayas, in  west-central Nepal. Manaslu means "mountain of the spirit" and the word is derived from the Sanskrit word manasa, meaning "intellect" or "soul". Manaslu was first climbed on May 9, 1956, by Toshio Imanishi and Gyalzen Norbu, members of a Japanese expedition. It is said that, given the many unsuccessful attempts by the British to climb Everest before Nepali Tenzing Norgay and New Zealander Edmund Hillary, "just as the British consider Everest their mountain, Manaslu has always been a Japanese mountain".[4][5].

Founded in 1946 as Wahingdoh Sports Club,[17][18] the club based in Shillong,[19] won numerous titles. However, with changing times and professionalisation, the amateur club began to face some amount of difficulty competing with younger clubs and it was then, that the decline began.. In 2007, Wahingdoh Sports Club was almost relegated to the 2nd Division League and as a result of inconsistent performance, the Wahingdoh community felt the need for a younger and more innovative approach.[20] In 2008, the club turned professional when it merged with Royal Football Club before being renamed Royal Wahingdoh FC under the able leadership of the club's owner Dominic Sutnga Tariang.[21] With the club witnessing several dramatic changes, a new chapter was in the making and in the very same year, the club bounced back to claim Third spot in the 2nd Division Regional League, a sign that brought hope for a brighter future.[22] In the First Division 2009 season, they created a record by winning all their games besides scoring 52 goals en route to lifting the title and along with it, an entry into the top tier of Meghalaya football, the Shillong Premier League.[22].

Action 1: Search[Ranters]
Observation 1: The Ranters were one of a number of dissenting groups that emerged around the time of the Commonwealth of England (1649–1660). They were largely common people,[1] and the movement was widespread throughout England, though they were not organised and had no leader.[citation needed]. The chaos of the Second English Civil War, the execution of King Charles I, and the animosity between the Presbyterians and Independents during the era of the Commonwealth gave rise to many sectarian groups that attempted to make sense of their society and place within that society. The Ranters were one such group. They were regarded as heretical by the established Church and seem to have been regarded by the government as a threat to social order.

These three languages are also referred to as the three administrative languages, as the constitution does not specify them as being "official". As of 2018, 98% of the population was able to speak French at more or less a high level (usually as a second language), 78% spoke German, and 77% Luxembourgish (which is the most common native language).[3]. Upon the founding of the country, French enjoyed the greatest prestige, and therefore gained preferential use as the official and administrative language. German was used in the political field to comment on the laws and the ordinances in order to make them comprehensible to everyone.

It is the first pan-regional LCC alliance. It comprises five, originally nine, Asia-Pacific airlines: Cebu Pacific, Cebgo, Jeju Air, Nok Air and Scoot..

Scoot's airline slogan is Escape the Ordinary.[6]. Scoot's fleet initially consisted of six Boeing 777-200ER aircraft previously operated by parent company Singapore Airlines. In 2015, Scoot began to transition its long-haul fleet to the Boeing 787 Dreamliner. Scoot also uses the Airbus A320, inherited from Tigerair, another low-cost Singaporean airline which merged with Scoot in July 2015, along with the Airbus A320neo and Airbus A321neo for its short-haul flights..
Since Scoot is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Singapore Airlines and is a significant member of the Value Alliance known for its international operations, it would be logical to deduce that Scoot is the airline operating within Terminal 2 of Narita International Airport. As such, the company that wholly owns the Value Alliance airline at Narita International Airport would be Singapore Airlines.

It is about 60 kilometers (37 mi) east of central Tokyo in Narita, Chiba.[2] The facility since July, 2019, covers 1,137 hectares (2,810 acres) of land and there are future plans to expand to nearly 1,200ha (3,000 acres)[3]. The conceptualization of Narita was highly controversial and remains so to the present day, especially among local residents in the area. This has led to the Sanrizuka Struggle, stemming from the government's decision to construct the airport without consulting most residents in the area, as well as expropriating their lands in the process. Even after the airport was eventually completed, air traffic movements have been controlled under various noise related operating restrictions due to its direct proximity with residential neighborhoods, including a house with a farm that is located right in between the runways.[citation needed] As a result, the airport must be closed from 00:00 (12:00am) to 06:00 (6:00am) the next day to minimize the noise pollution impact around the airport.[4].

Observation 1: The Border War is a rivalry between the athletic programs of the University of Kansas and the University of Missouri.[1] It has been officially named the Border Showdown since 2004, and promoted as the Hy-Vee Hoops Border Showdown for basketball games since 2021.[2] The rivalry is more known for football and men's basketball, however, the rivalry exists in all sports. The Kansas Jayhawks and the Missouri Tigers began playing each other in 1891. From 1907 to 2012 both schools were in the same athletic conference and competed annually in all sports. Sports Illustrated described the rivalry as the oldest (Division I) rivalry west of the Mississippi River in 2011,[3] but went dormant after Missouri departed the Big 12 Conference for the Southeastern Conference on July 1, 2012. Despite Missouri wanting to continue athletic competition, no further regular season games were scheduled between the two schools for several years.[4] However, the two schools played an exhibition game in men's basketball on October 22, 2017, with Kansas defeating Missouri 93–87.

Action 1: Search[Gilliam-class attack transports]
Observation 1: The Gilliam-class attack transport was a class of attack transport built for service with the US Navy in World War II.. Like all attack transports, the purpose of the Gilliams was to transport troops and equipment to foreign shores in order to execute amphibious invasions using an array of smaller amphibious assault boats carried by the attack transport itself. The Gilliam-class was heavily armed with antiaircraft weaponry to protect itself and its cargo of troops from air attack in the battle zone.. The Gilliam-class was designed by San Francisco naval architects Joslyn & Ryan and designated by the Maritime Commission (MARCOM) as type S4-SE2-BD1. The Gilliams were significantly smaller, both in size and displacement, than other classes of attack transports.

Action 1: Search[Frigg]
Observation 1: Frigg (/frɪɡ/; Old Norse: [ˈfriɡː])[1] is a goddess, one of the Æsir, in Germanic mythology. In Norse mythology, the source of most surviving information about her, she is associated with marriage, prophecy, clairvoyance and motherhood, and dwells in the wetland halls of Fensalir. In wider Germanic mythology, she is known in Old High German as Frīja, in Langobardic as Frēa, in Old English as Frīg, in Old Frisian as Frīa, and in Old Saxon as Frī, all ultimately stemming from the Proto-Germanic theonym *Frijjō. Nearly all sources portray her as the wife of the god Odin.. In Old High German and Old Norse sources, she is specifically connected with Fulla, but she is also associated with the goddesses Lofn, Hlín, Gná, and ambiguously with the Earth, otherwise personified as an apparently separate entity Jörð (Old Norse: 'Earth').
This passage mentions Frigg’s associations in general terms, discussing marriage, prophecy, clairvoyance, and motherhood, as well as her dwelling and connections with other goddesses.

Action 1: Search[John O'Hara]
Observation 1: John Henry O'Hara (January 31, 1905 – April 11, 1970) was one of America's most prolific writers of short stories, credited with helping to invent The New Yorker magazine short story style.[1] He became a best-selling novelist before the age of 30 with Appointment in Samarra and BUtterfield 8. While O'Hara's legacy as a writer is debated, his champions rank him highly among the under-appreciated and unjustly neglected major American writers of the 20th century.[2] Few college students educated after O'Hara's death in 1970 have discovered him, chiefly because he refused to allow his work to be reprinted in anthologies used to teach literature at the college level.. "O’Hara may not have been the best story writer of the twentieth century, but he is the most addictive," wrote Lorin Stein, then editor-in-chief of the Paris Review, in a 2013 appreciation of O'Hara's work. Stein added, "You can binge on his collections the way some people binge on Mad Men, and for some of the same reasons. On the topics of class, sex, and alcohol—that is, the topics that mattered to him—his novels amount to a secret history of American life."[3] His work stands out from that of his contemporary authors for its unvarnished realism.[citation needed].

Author of the "profoundly sensitive, fresh and beautiful" poetry of Gitanjali,[7] he became in 1913 the first non-European and the first lyricist to win the Nobel Prize in Literature.[8] Tagore's poetic songs were viewed as spiritual and mercurial; where his elegant prose and magical poetry were widely popular in the Indian subcontinent.[9] He was a fellow of the Royal Asiatic Society. Referred to as "the Bard of Bengal",[10][5][6] Tagore was known by sobriquets: Gurudeb, Kobiguru, and Biswokobi.[a]. A Bengali Brahmin from Calcutta with ancestral gentry roots in Burdwan district[12] and Jessore, Tagore wrote poetry as an eight-year-old.[13] At the age of sixteen, he released his first substantial poems under the pseudonym Bhānusiṃha ("Sun Lion"), which were seized upon by literary authorities as long-lost classics.[14] By 1877 he graduated to his first short stories and dramas, published under his real name. As a humanist, universalist, internationalist, and ardent critic of nationalism,[15] he denounced the British Raj and advocated independence from Britain.

Action 1: Search[dictator game]
Observation 1: The dictator game is a popular experimental instrument in social psychology and economics,[1] a derivative of the ultimatum game. The term "game" is a misnomer because it captures a decision by a single player: to send money to another or not.[2] Thus, the dictator has the most power and holds the preferred position in this “game.” Although the “dictator” has the most power and presents a take it or leave it offer, the game has mixed results based on different behavioral attributes.[3] The results – where most "dictators" choose to send money – evidence the role of fairness and norms in economic behavior, and undermine the assumption of narrow self-interest when given the opportunity to maximise one's own profits.[4]. The dictator game is a derivative of the ultimatum game, in which one player (the proposer) provides a one-time offer to the other (the responder). The responder can choose to either accept or reject the proposer's bid, but rejecting the bid would result in both players receiving a payoff of 0. In the dictator game, the first player, "the dictator", determines how to split an endowment (such as a cash prize) between themselves and the second player[5] (the recipient).

Thought 7: Given the difficulty in finding a direct connection between Steve Coogan and "Spitting Image" as well as the unsuccessful search for a list of voice artists for the show, it seems that the available data does not provide a definitive answer to the original question. However, Craig Charles is also mentioned in the original documentary, and he is known to be an actor and comedian. It is a possibility that he could be the voice artist mentioned, but this would also need confirmation.

Action 2: Search[Andrea Chénier]
Observation 2: Andrea Chénier (Italian pronunciation: [anˈdrɛːa ʃʃeˈnje]) is a verismo opera in four acts by Umberto Giordano, set to an Italian libretto by Luigi Illica, and first performed on 28 March 1896 at La Scala, Milan. The story is based loosely on the life of the French poet André Chénier (1762–1794), who was executed during the French Revolution. The character Carlo Gérard is partly based on Jean-Lambert Tallien, a leading figure in the Revolution. It remains popular with audiences, though less frequently performed than in the first half of the 20th century. One reason for its survival in the repertoire is the lyrical-dramatic music provided by Giordano for the tenor lead, which gives a talented singer opportunities to demonstrate his skills and flaunt his voice.
Carlo Gérard is a character in the opera "Andrea Chénier" by Umberto Giordano. This opera is not a play, but an opera in four acts, which means that the third act would be part of the opera.

Observation 1: Muammar Muhammad Abu Minyar al-Gaddafi[pron 1] (c. 1942 – 20 October 2011) was a Libyan revolutionary, politician and political theorist who was the de facto ruler of Libya from 1969 until his capture and killing in 2011 by NATO-backed[13][14] rebel forces.[15][16] He first served as Revolutionary Chairman of the Libyan Arab Republic from 1969 to 1977 and then as the Brotherly Leader of the Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya from 1977 to 2011. Initially ideologically committed to Arab nationalism and Arab socialism, Gaddafi later ruled according to his own Third International Theory.. Born in Qasr Abu Hadi a small village near Sirte, Italian Libya, to a poor Bedouin Arab family, Gaddafi became an Arab nationalist while at school in Sabha, later enrolling in the Royal Military Academy, Benghazi. Within the military, he founded a revolutionary group which deposed the Western-backed Senussi monarchy of King Idris in a 1969 Revolution. Having taken power, Gaddafi converted Libya into a republic governed by his Revolutionary Command Council.

Observation 4: The Libyan Crisis[1][2] is the current humanitarian crisis[3][4] and political-military instability[5] occurring in Libya, beginning with the Arab Spring protests of 2011, which led to two civil wars, foreign military intervention, and the ousting and death of Muammar Gaddafi. The first civil war's aftermath and proliferation of armed groups led to violence and instability across the country, which erupted into renewed civil war in 2014. The second war lasted until October 23, 2020, when all parties agreed to a permanent ceasefire and negotiations.[6]. The crisis in Libya has resulted in tens of thousands of casualties since the onset of violence in early 2011. During both civil wars, the output of Libya's economically crucial oil industry collapsed to a small fraction of its usual level, with most facilities blockaded or damaged by rival groups, despite having the largest oil reserves of any African country.[7][8].

Thought 1: I need to search for the recipes of Cosmopolitan and Cuba Libre cocktails and find the common ingredient between them.
Action 1: Search[Cosmopolitan (cocktail)]
Observation 1: A cosmopolitan, or, informally, a cosmo, is a cocktail made with vodka, Cointreau, cranberry juice, and freshly squeezed or sweetened lime juice.. The cosmopolitan is a relative of cranberry coolers like the Cape Codder.[1][2] Though often presented far differently, the cosmopolitan also bears a likeness in composition to the kamikaze cocktail.. The International Bartenders Association recipe is based on vodka citron, lemon-flavored vodka.[3] The use of citrus-flavored vodka as the basis for this cocktail appears to have been widely popularized in the mid-1990s by cocktail expert Dale DeGroff[4] and is used in the IBA-approved recipe. Many bartenders, however, continue to use a standard unflavored vodka — this alternative would undoubtedly be historically consistent with any of the supposed predecessors of this drink that were popular in Ohio, Provincetown, or Minneapolis during the 1970s, or in San Francisco during the 1980s.[5][6][7][8] A lemon twist is sometimes used to garnish.. The cosmopolitan is usually served in a large cocktail glass, also called a martini glass.

Observation 2: Rum and Coke, or the Cuba libre (/ˌkjuːbə ˈliːbreɪ/ KEW-bə LEE-bray, Spanish: [ˈkuβa ˈliβɾe]; literally "Free Cuba"), is a highball cocktail consisting of cola, rum, and in many recipes lime juice on ice. Traditionally, the cola ingredient is Coca-Cola ("Coke") and the alcohol is a light rum such as Bacardi; however, the drink may be made with various types of rums and cola brands, and lime juice may or may not be included.. The cocktail originated in the early 20th century in Cuba, after the country won independence in the Spanish–American War. It subsequently became popular across Cuba, the United States, and other countries. Its simple recipe and inexpensive, ubiquitous ingredients have made it one of the world's most-popular alcoholic drinks.

Although keenly anticipated on release, Dark Horse is associated with the controversial North American tour that Harrison staged with Indian classical musician Ravi Shankar in November and December that year. This was the first US tour by a member of the Beatles since 1966, and the public's nostalgia for the band, together with Harrison contracting laryngitis during rehearsals and choosing to feature Shankar so heavily in the programme, resulted in scathing concert reviews from some influential music critics..

The first volume's plot revolved around the main characters traveling to Neverland from Storybrooke to retrieve a kidnapped Henry Mills from the possession of an evil Peter Pan. After successfully retrieving Henry, the characters returned to Storybrooke, only to be returned to their original worlds following Pan's attempt to cast a new curse, leaving Emma Swan and Henry to escape to New York City after Rumplestiltskin killed himself and Pan who was revealed to be his father. The second volume's plot followed the characters' past journey in the Enchanted Forest and how they were brought back to Storybrooke by Zelena, the Wicked Witch of the West, and Regina's sister, while also documenting Emma's mission to break the new curse and save her family..

The ship was scuttled to evade discovery, and remained undiscovered until May 2019.[4]. After the Civil War and emancipation, Lewis and other members of the Clotilda group became free.

U.S. involvement in the Atlantic slave trade had been banned by Congress through the Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves enacted on March 2, 1807 (effective January 1, 1808), but the practice continued illegally, especially through slave traders based in New York[citation needed] in the 1850s and early 1860. In the case of the Clotilda, the voyage's sponsors were based in the South and planned to buy Africans in Whydah, Dahomey.[1][2] After the voyage, the ship was burned and scuttled in Mobile Bay in an attempt to destroy the evidence..

Action 4: Search[Tibouchina]
Observation 4: Tibouchina /ˌtɪbuːˈkaɪnə/[2][3] is a neotropical flowering plant genus in the family Melastomataceae.[4][5][6] Species of this genus are subshrubs, shrubs or small trees and typically have purple flowers.[7] They are native to Mexico, the Caribbean, and South America where they are found as far south as northern Argentina.[1][7][8] Members of this genus are known as glory bushes, glory trees or princess flowers. The name Tibouchina is adapted from a Guianan indigenous name for a member of this genus.[3] A systematic study in 2013 showed that as then circumscribed the genus was paraphyletic,[4] and in 2019 the genus was split into a more narrowly circumscribed Tibouchina, two re-established genera Pleroma and Chaetogastra, and a new genus, Andesanthus.[9]. Tibouchina species are subshrubs, shrubs or small trees. Their leaves are opposite, usually with petioles, and often covered with scales. The inflorescence is a panicle or some modification of a panicle with reduced branching.

Singer Robert Plant used many of the original lyrics and the songwriting is credited to Memphis Minnie and the individual members of Led Zeppelin.[1]  Many other artists have performed and recorded versions of the song.. When blues musical duo Kansas Joe McCoy and Memphis Minnie wrote "When the Levee Breaks", the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927 was still fresh in people's memories.[2]  The flooding affected 26,000 square miles of the Mississippi Delta – hundreds were killed and hundreds of thousands of residents were forced to evacuate.[3]  The event is the subject of several blues songs, the most popular being "Backwater Blues" by Bessie Smith (1927) and "Mississippi Heavy Water Blues" by Barbecue Bob (1928).[4].

Based on a real-life story, the film centers on a taxi driver from Seoul who unintentionally becomes involved in the events of the Gwangju Uprising in 1980. It is based on German journalist Jürgen Hinzpeter's interactions with driver Kim Sa-bok; however, as very little information on Kim was  known at the time the film was made, most elements regarding his life and the events that happened to him outside of Gwangju are fictional.. The film was released on 2 August 2017, in South Korea.[6] It was very positively received by critics, who praised its unique approach to depicting the Gwangju Uprising events, emotional weight, as well as the main character and his relationship with Hinzpeter, and was selected as the South Korean entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 90th Academy Awards.[7][8] The film was a notable commercial success: it was the second highest-grossing film of 2017 in South Korea, and currently stands as the thirteenth highest-grossing South Korean film in history.[9][10]. The film centers around the Gwangju Uprising that occurred from 18 May 1980, to 27 May 1980, and it is estimated to have led to 2,000 people being killed.

Action 1: Search[Season of Migration to the North]
Observation 1: Season of Migration to the North (Arabic: موسم الهجرة إلى الشمال Mawsim al-Hijrah ilâ al-Shamâl) is a classic postcolonial Arabic novel by the Sudanese novelist Tayeb Salih, published in 1966; it is the novel for which he is best known. It was first published in the Beirut journal Hiwâr. The main concern of the novel is with the impact of British colonialism and European modernity on rural African societies in general and Sudanese culture and identity in particular.[1] His novel reflects the conflicts of modern Sudan and depicts the brutal history of European colonialism as shaping the reality of contemporary Sudanese society. Damascus-based Arab Literary Academy named it one of the best novels in Arabic of the twentieth century. Mawsim al-Hijrah ilâ al-Shamâl is considered to be an important turning point in the development of postcolonial narratives that focus on the encounter between East and West.[1].
The observation provides general information about "Season of Migration to the North" and its themes, but it does not mention a specific Polish-British novelist. Since "counter narrative" implies a response or a contrasting perspective to another work, I need to find the specific novella that "Season of Migration to the North" is countering. Given the colonial themes, Joseph Conrad, a notable Polish-British novelist known for his work dealing with colonialism, particularly "Heart of Darkness," might be relevant. I should search for a connection between Tayeb Salih and Joseph Conrad or look up references to a counter narrative within "Season of Migration to the North." Lookup[counter narrative]

After the adoption of the Type 74, the Japanese High Command was already looking for a superior, completely indigenous tank design to defeat the Soviet T-72. As a result, development of a prototype, the TK-X MBT began between 1976 and 1977. Joint development was performed by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and TRDI (Japan Defense Agency's Technology Research and Development Institute).

Observation 4: The Type 10 (10式戦車, Hitomaru-shiki sensha) is a fourth generation main battle tank of JSDF produced by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries for the Japanese Ground Self Defense Force, entering service in 2012. Compared with other currently-serving main battle tanks in the JGSDF, the Type 10 has been equipped with enhancements in its capability to respond to anti-tank warfare and other contingencies.[4]. The TK-X (MBT-X) project aimed to produce the new Type 10 main battle tank, to replace or complement the existing Type 74 and Type 90 main battle tanks that are currently in service with the Japan Ground Self Defense Force.[5] Development began in the 1990s, and production was expected to start in 2010–2011. A prototype was revealed on February 13, 2008, at the Technology Research and Development Institute (TRDI) in Sagamihara.[5] Heavy emphasis was placed on C4I capabilities as well as on performance, firepower, protection and mobility.[6]. In the early 2000s, Japan decided to update its tank force to better prepare for 21st-century warfare.

Turner compiled 118 wins during his head coaching tenure, which are the most for an NFL head coach with a losing record. He is also the only NFL head coach to have both 100 wins and an overall losing record..

ohh... The search for Norv Turner did not reveal a brother who could be Scott Turner's uncle. It is possible that the information about the family relations is not provided in the current passage. Since the observation after searching for Norv Turner does not yield any information about his brother, and since I cannot find the name of Scott Turner's uncle head coach directly, it might be best to attempt a different approach to answer the question.

I should try to find out if there are any public records or news articles that mention Scott Turner and his uncle who is a head coach. This information might be available in public sports news archives or databases. However, within the scope of this task, I'm limited to Wikipedia and provided passages. Since a "Lookup" for "brother" did not yield results, it suggests that the necessary information is either not present or not directly available.

Given this dead end, I cannot accurately complete this task. The necessary step would be to look up public resources outside of these constraints to find the information about Scott Turner's uncle and the conference of the team he coaches. Without this information, I am unable to provide the answer to the question about the conference of the team coached by Scott Turner's uncle.

Initially called Executioner, the band changed its name to Xecutioner in 1986 to avoid confusion with the thrash metal band Executioner from Boston, and then changed its name once again to Obituary in 1988. Obituary's current lineup consists of vocalist John Tardy, drummer Donald Tardy, rhythm guitarist Trevor Peres, bassist Terry Butler, and lead guitarist Ken Andrews.

Stza was raised in New York by his mother, who he classified as an "over-protective Jewish mom". He rarely saw his biological father, and his stepfather died by suicide.[2] As a teenager, he dropped out of high school, ran away from home, and began riding freight trains.[3] During this time, he began using heroin and crack cocaine. He later described drugs as a positive influence in his life and said that he would have killed himself during this time if not for drugs because he was "very lonely and suicidal."[4].

Observation 2: Dial M for Murder is a 1954 American crime thriller film directed by Alfred Hitchcock,[4] starring Ray Milland, Grace Kelly, Robert Cummings, Anthony Dawson, and John Williams. Both the screenplay and the successful stage play on which it was based were written by English playwright Frederick Knott. The play premiered in 1952 on BBC Television,[5] before being performed on stage in the same year in London's West End in June, and then New York's Broadway in October.. Originally intended to be shown in dual-strip polarized 3-D, the film played in most theatres in ordinary 2-D due to the loss of interest in the 3-D process (the projection of which was difficult and error-prone) by the time of its release.[6] The film earned an estimated $2.7 million in North American box office sales in 1954.[7]. In the mid-1950s, Tony Wendice, a retired English professional tennis player, is married to wealthy socialite Margot, who has been having an affair with their friend Mark Halliday, an American crime-fiction writer.
